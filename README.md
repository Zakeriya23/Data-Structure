# CS163 Data Structures

Course Catalog: Data abstraction with formal specification. Elementary algorithm analysis.
Basic concepts of data and its representation inside a computer. Linear, linked, and
orthogonal lists; tree structures. Data structures are implemented as data abstractions.
Sorting and searching strategies. Data management.
Our goal is to acquaint you with the structures used in C++ for the storage and manipulation
of data. The concept of data abstraction and the problem of building implementations of
abstract data types are emphasized. Both static and dynamic implementations of major
structures are presented and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed.
Structures include lists of several types, stacks, queues, trees, binary trees, B-trees and
graphs. Recursion and key transformation (hashing) are examined. We encourage you to
stretch the boundaries of your programming skills. Start examining algorithms in terms of
their efficiency and effectiveness.
